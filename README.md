**Project Description**

This project is a Python-based Sporting Goods Management System developed as a two-phase semester project. The goal is to model, manage, and analyze data for a sporting goods business using core Python programming concepts while simulating real-world data operations.

**Phase 1: Data Modeling and Management**

In Phase 1, the system is designed using multiple relational tables represented as Python dictionaries. Key tables include Products, Categories, Suppliers, Inventory, and Sales. Each table uses automatically generated unique integer IDs to ensure data consistency. A menu-driven user interface allows users to add new records, search for entries by ID, modify existing data, and display formatted table outputs. The program includes input validation and exception handling, and all data is saved to and loaded from CSV files for persistent storage.

**Phase 2: Data Generation and Analysis**

Phase 2 extends the project by generating realistic fake datasets to simulate actual business operations. These datasets are loaded into the system and converted into pandas DataFrames. Exploratory data analysis is performed using basic statistical measures and visualizations to examine inventory distribution, product categories, supplier contributions, and sales patterns. Several analyses combine data from multiple tables, demonstrating table joins and relational analysis using Python.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical skills in Python programming, data modeling, file handling, and data analysis, providing a strong foundation for managing and analyzing sporting goods business data efficiently.
